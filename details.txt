# 🤖 **3. AI/ML Features Implemented (Easy + Moderate Only)**

## 🟢 **EASY AI Features**

### 1. **Basic Resume Parsing (NLP)**

* Extracts text, skills, education, and tools from PDF resumes using TF-IDF/spaCy.
* Converts unstructured resume text → structured profile data.

### 2. **Skill Gap Detection (Keyword Matching)**

* Compares job-required skills with student resume skills.
* Highlights missing skills for students.

### 3. **Rule-Based Job Recommendations (Student Module)**

* Suggests jobs in which the student meets most requirements.
* Based on skill overlap, CGPA, and eligibility rules.

### 4. **Candidate Ranking (Company Module)**

* Combines similarity score + CGPA to rank students.
* Helps companies quickly shortlist top candidates.

### 5. **AI Analytics Dashboard (TNP Module – Basic)**

* Shows placement count, top skills, number of jobs, shortlists.
* Aggregates data using simple statistical analysis.

## 🟡 **MODERATE AI Features**

### 6. **NER-Based Resume Parsing (Enhanced NLP)**

* Uses spaCy’s Named Entity Recognition to extract:

  * Skills
  * Projects
  * Certifications
  * Education
  * Experience

### 7. **Semantic Job–Resume Matching**

* Converts job descriptions and resumes into embeddings (Sentence-BERT / TF-IDF vectors).
* Calculates **cosine similarity** to measure job–candidate fit.

### 8. **AI Job Recommendations (Semantic-Based)**

* Recommends top N jobs to students based on semantic similarity.
* Much more accurate than keyword matching.

### 9. **Skill Gap Summary (TNP Analytics)**

* AI identifies common missing skills across the student pool.
